            <p> The project aims to visually communicate the complex relationships 
              between education and economicindicators by designing interactive 
              visualizations that enable users to explore data dynamically and 
              gain insights. Additionally, it focuses on creating an engaging 
              and intuitive interface that ensures easy navigation and enhances
              the data comprehension.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p> The fundamental goals of this project are to: </p>
            <p>1. Educational Outreach:
            Develop a user-friendly tool to help educators and students 
            understand the relationship between education and economic 
            indicators globally. 
            </p>
            <p> 2. Policy and Decision Support:

            data to support decisions related to education and economic 
            development.
            </p>
            <p> 3. Research Enhancement:
            Offer researchers a platform to explore and analyze the impact 
            of educational investment on economic outcomes and how economic 
            prosperity can enhance educational opportunities.
            </p>
            <p> 4. Public Awareness and Engagement:
            Create visually compelling displays of data to raise public 
            awareness about the essential link between education and economic health.
